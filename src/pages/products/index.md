heading: What we offer
description: >-
  A customizable CMS that understands science. We support all the usual features 
  you've come to expect from blogging platforms, like image, video, and file import, 
  and text (including markdown and a WYSIWYG editor). User authentication and a 
  Draft > Review > Publish workflow allow for separate authors and editors, to ensure
  changes are not published without consent. The admin user can configure the fields 
  that should be populated when new content is created.

        A custom private hosted CMS: your site is designed by Explorable Labs, hosted
        by Netlify, and developed by you! You decide which users to invite to read, 
        author, and administer content using our science-literate UI.

        You control your data: All content you upload or create is stored in your
        own account for the service(s) you choose: github or bitbucket for 
        smaller datasets and for the website itself. 
        Cloudinary or Uploadcare for larger files or images. Contact
        us about connecting to your in-house managed database for larger datasets.

        Integrated public science datasets save time for your scientists: just
        use our custom widgets to include data for a Pubchem or Chembl ID, a 
        gene symbol, or, (more coming soon!)
