### Privacy-first
You control your data via your own account on github, bitbucket, Uploadcare, etc.

### Editor workflow
Preview your changes, and let a reviewer sign off (or make additional edits) before publishing.

### HTTPS is automatic
Your site will automatically be secured with a free TLS certificate from Letâ€™s Encrypt.

### API/microservices
Functions can be run on AWS Lambda or Fargate, to incorporate compute-intensive resources into your site.

### JAMstack
Modern web development: our serverless approach makes your site fast to develop and fast to use. https://jamstack.org/

### Hosted CMS as a service
